# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This week’s homework requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

This application was created to generate a secure password for Users by HTML, CSS, but mainly Javascipt. In order to make the passwword unique and secured the app will be using different characters such as: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, number, symbols, and also emojis. 

For the application to run the User must meet some criterias:
  1. The length of the password must be between 8 - 128 characters long.

    - If User click cancel or does not meet the length requirement, they will be asked to "Try again"
  
  2. Password must have at least ONE of the five characters below:

    - Special characters (Symbols),
    - Numbers,
    - Lowercase Letters,
    - Uppercase Letters,
    - Emojis
    

    - If User does not choose one, they will be asked to "Try again"
